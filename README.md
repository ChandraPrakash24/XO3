## üòõ XO3

A tic-tac-toe game based on emojis that offers both multiplayer and single-player modes. Every time a user plays in single or multiplayer mode, there are always new emojis. In single-player mode, there's a choice between hard and easy modes for the bot. I bet you can't beat the hard mode of the bot üòâ

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Player 

In this mode, you will play against a computer bot. 

- Click on the 'Single Player' button to play.
- Choose a player - there are always new emojis appearing whenever you visit the select player page.
- Then, choose the game mode you want to play with the bot - Hard or Easy.
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see two buttons:
  - **Replay'** button to play again.
  - **Home** button to return to the main menu.
- If you close the browser or leave the page and come back, you'll resume the game from where you left off.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplayer 

In this mode, you can play with another person sitting next to you.

- The first player is automatically selected, and the second player automatically gets their own emoji (random for every game round).
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see two buttons:
  - 'Replay' button to play again.
  - 'Home' button to return to the main menu.
- If you close the browser or leave the page and come back, you'll resume the game from where you left off.

## üí° Idea

Project: [https://github.com/ChandraPrakash24/XO3.git](https://github.com/ChandraPrakash24/XO3.git)

I've built a tic-tac-toe game before using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which was single-player only. I've always wanted to expand the project by adding multiplayer and making it more interactive. Emojis are something I've also always wanted since I've never seen a tic-tac-toe with emojis.

This is why I decided to create this project again, this time using React and TypeScript. I also had in mind that every time I've played a tic-tac-toe game online, I found most of them boring, that's why with the emojis.

## ü§î How Can It Be Improved?

The project could be improved by adding sound effects and background music. I think it would also be cool to highlight the three rows that the user got to win, to show at the end who won.

## üö¶ Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn start dev` to get the project started.
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the address shown in your console) in your web browser to view the app.
